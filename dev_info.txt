Loan Calculator Project

Create new Laravel Project

Open command prompt (assume prompt opens in C:\Users\username)

cd Documents
mkdir CCC_LoanCalc
or
laravel new CCC_LoanCalc
cd CCC_LoanCalc
composer update
//install our gulp stuff - package.json is Oalready preconfigured with Laravel.
npm install --no-bin-links

To get phpspec to run on windows you need to uninstall and reinstall it via composer because the Laravel installer does not create a phpspec.bat file in the vendor/bin directory to properly launch phpspec on windows. To fix this just open a command prompt in your project root dir and type:
composer remove phpspec/phpspec --dev
composer require phpspec/phpspec --dev

Then you'll be able to run phpspec by typing "vendor\bin\phpspec". 

Or, alternately, if you're a massochist, you can run it from the vendor\phpspec dir, but then you have to pass it the location of your phpspec.yml file. Here's an example command that creates a spec file for SomeClass: 
php vendor\phpspec\phpspec\bin\phpspec -c=phpspec.yml describe App\SomeClass, assuming your namespace is "App": 

LoanCalculator( $principal, $termLength, $apr) => array( minimumPayment => 10.00, totalInterest=>10.00, grandTotal => 10.00)
